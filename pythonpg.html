	<h2><u>The Basics:</u></h2>


	<h3>Functions-</h3>


	<u>Printing-</u>

	<p>
		Printing is probably the most used thing in python, You can use it to talk to the user, You can use it to debug,<br>
		You can use it to show what variables store at that point in the code and loads more, Its such a simple<br>
		function to use, All you need is  > <b>print( )</b> <
	</p>

	Heres an example:

	<u>Math/Equations-</u>

	<p>
		Knowing how to do math equations in python is very helpful for making useful programs, You can use it to add, divide,
		multiply and subtract variables, it's a very simple function. But, theres something you need to know,
		if you're new to computers you may think you multiply and divide by using 'x' and 'รท', which is true in the real world,
		but not in python. Instead you need to use '*' and '/', these are the actual operators for multiplication and division.
